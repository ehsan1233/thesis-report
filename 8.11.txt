started to use another python library for connecting data to mysql : mysql.connector
it has possibility to add charset to connection .

cnx = mysql.connector.connect(user='root', password='root',
                              host='localhost',
                              database='tweetTable',
                              charset = 'utf8mb4')

for solving the problem of unseadable emojis and not having breaks in streaming codes, problem solved by using utf8mb4. 
because . MySQL’s UTF8 only allocates 3 bytes per character, but the whole range of of UTF8 characters, including Emoji, requires 4 bytes.
MySQL defaults to UTF8 when you create a table, therefore you must specify the character set. 
The character set we want is utf8mb4. This character set provides 4 bit UTF8 functionality.

it started collecting tweets on 8th November from 8:00 pm to 10th November 8:00 pm
