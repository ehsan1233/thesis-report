started to look into tweets and count the number of tweets with emoji's 
it is usefull for labeling data and creating the training set 

according to the 8.11 results we have 
numrows =  50919
Number of tweets with smilies = 635

this smilies are just just this list 
:-) :) :o) :] :3 :c) :> =] 8) =) :} :^) :D 8-D 8D x-D xD X-D XD =-D =D =-3 =3 B^D

we need to extend the list of smilies to find more tweets with them. it increases the number of training set
